Summer 2012 I did a course on how to get more out of life. Basically if you treat yourself like you would a project or a business, you get more focus. So I started a mission statement for myself, some rules (the strategy to ensure I keep on my mission), and some short term goals.

However if I never read them, and few people see them, then this has no use. So in a bold move I OpenSourced my person life plan. Now you can fork or clone my view on life, or submit bugs where you think I am not being true to myself.

So In this repo you can find:
 - [my life mission](./missie.md)
 - [current year goals](../doelen2022.md)
 - [my resume](./resume.md)
