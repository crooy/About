I *Make things*,  
I teach,
I learn,
I enjoy the small things, 
I pause for the silent moments, 
I cook and eat beautiful food,
I dance, sing, and drink to beautiful music,
I take risks,
and I let go of my worries.

I do the above with friends and family, 
but mostly with my wife and children.

I surround myself with people who are
inspiring, dedicated, fun, and most of all smart.
They challenge my opinions, teach me, and learn from me, 
and help me do the things I do.
