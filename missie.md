I *Make things*,  
I work hard, and start things,
I dance, sing, and drink to beautiful music.
I either let go of my worries, or I take responsibility.

I do the above with friends and family 
but mostly with my wife and children, 
whom I provide for and protect.

I surround myself with people who are
progressive, transparant,
and most of all smart.
They challenge my opinions, teach me, and learn from me.
